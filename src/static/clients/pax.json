  "description": "Pax is an extremely lightweight Spacebar client designed to work on old browsers and controlled environments. It's currently in development, born in November 2025, and takes the form of a single HTML file of ~180 Ko that can be locally stored anywhere and opened in a browser without any hosting setup. This also allows Pax to bypass parental controls such as Google Family Link.",
